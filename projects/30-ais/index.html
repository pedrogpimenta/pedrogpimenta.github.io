    <h1>AIS Channel</h1>
<p>App made as a better front-end for the <strong>McDonaldsCupons.cat</strong> website. The website was losing users and it was clear: the website needed a better way for users to interact with.</p>
<p>The users were able to register, login with the previous account, get and redeem coupons in a much easier way, just showing their smartphone  in the restaurant with the open coupon.</p>
<p>We also built a <strong>notification when you were near</strong> a McDonald's to actively engage with the user.</p>
